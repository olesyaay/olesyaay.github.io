                    Now the difference between a unicorn and
                    a pegasus is quite clear a unicorn has a
                    horn which usually stores their magically
                    powers while a pegasus can only fly with
                    its gorgeous wings. Now the difference
                    between a unicorn and a pegasus is quite
                    clear a unicorn has a horn.
